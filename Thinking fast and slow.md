It talks in terms of system 1 and system 2.

System 1 is the gut instinct part of the brain, it processes things
subconsciously and is generally pretty correct.  It can be tricked though, or
at least primed for a response.  If it thinks it's required, then it'll get
system 2 involved, which is basically the newer part of the brain which does
the conscious (slower) thinking.

The annoying thing about system1 and being primed, is that it happens
_regardless_ of whether you want it to.  It really is automatic.  The book
points to lots of experiments where people were primed and responded in various
ways.  One of the more interesting was money.  Get people to think about money
and they basically become more self centered, selfish, meaner (and focused
perhaps).  What does that tell us about society?

If you're in a happy space, or if it's made _easy_ for you to think something,
then you basically will (automatically).  for example, 

    How many types of each animal did Moses bring on the ark?

What did you answer?  Did you notice anything [[strange?]]
