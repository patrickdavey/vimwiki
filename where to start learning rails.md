 Hi @vbakaitis, these are the things I often recommend to folks getting going with Ruby & Rails

• _The Well Grounded Rubyist_ (https://www.manning.com/books/the-well-grounded-rubyist-third-edition). This is a great intro to Ruby - it groks the vibe of the language  well IMHO.
• _The Rails guides_ are a good way to get going with Rails. I (and I'm guessing many other folk on here) still refer to them pretty regularly. The are a good balance of the right amount of info to get most things done with Rails
• _The Rails Way_ (https://leanpub.com/tr5w)  is great when you need to go deeper than the guides. It's not much of a narrative tbh but does a good job of contextualising the very large surface area of Rails

I should also mention https://www.poodr.com/ - it's not a book you _need_ to get started with Ruby or Rails *but* it is a great book about software (the examples happen to be in Ruby but will be applicable to any language you use). If you are getting into Ruby it would be a pity not to read it at some point :slightly_smiling_face:
