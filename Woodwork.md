Because of Matthias Wandel I fell in love with woodworking. I love his no nonsense style. 

Jimmy Diresta is an American who always shows his name in the scenes. But I find his fabrication (not all woodworking) excellent and creative. 

Frank Howarth is not only excellent for his wood working, but also for his vids. Uses fancy stop motion in his videos. 

Paul Sellers is old school. His workshop is unplugged. He teaches all the old skills.
