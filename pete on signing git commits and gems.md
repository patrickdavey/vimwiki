ep. I like to verify that the commits came from my key. I keep my signing key password in my password manager. It would be very hard for someone to forge one of my commits. (edited)

I set `user.signingkey` in Git

aupajo  [4 minutes ago]
```git config --global user.email blah@blah.com
git config --global user.signingkey abcdef123```

My global config is set to my work signing key, and if I have OSS or personal stuff I just configure a different email/signing key on a per repo basis (just drop the `--global`).

I sign the gem and generate SHA checksums that go in the repo: https://github.com/Aupajo/almanack/tree/master/checksums
