### Summary of [So good they can't ignore you](http://www.amazon.com/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You/dp/1455509124/) ###

Link to a bunch of interviews with different people about their career paths.

Basically the idea of *_follow your passion_* is bad advice.  Get the skills
first and then you'll be able to get the career / job / calling you want.
People like Jobs etc. had the skills and worked damn hard - it wasn't just that
they followed their passion (however much they may want you to believe it).
Also it's just basically bad doctrine as it leads you to think that if you
aren't passionate about something then you need to move on and find the *one
thing* that you are passionate about... but then you start off again at the
bottom rung of the ladder.

Two different types of mindset (really quite like the mindset book, the
'Passion' Mindset and the 'Craftsman (Growth) Mindset).  Passion asks what can
this job/situation give me, Craftsman is about what you can bring to the
job/situation (and how you can give the very best you can).  If you can become
a craftsman, that's when the pillars of *impact, creativity and control* will
come out in the your job.

### 10,000 Hours ###
10,000 hours is all well and good, but only if you're putting in
deliberate practice - otherwise you're just going to plateaux.  The problem
with deliberate practice is that it's hard work and it's uncomfortable hard
work at that.  It takes you past where you're comfortable - or from the
[Ruby Rogues Episode](http://rubyrogues.com/131-rr-how-to-learn/) you need to push
into the things that are hard, embrace, extend!

    Deliberate Practice is actively designed, typically by a teacher, for the
    sole purpose of effectively improving specific aspects of an individuals
    performance.

*Decide your capital market*

The idea here is that you're either in a winner
takes all or auction market.  Winner takes all means there's one skill you
need to be the best at (script writing).  Auction means there are lots of
skills and you can decide which ones you want to improve at.

*Capital Type*:

Once you know your market, how do you get the skills?  If
it's auction best way is to go with doors you can easily get into (i.e. what
opportunities does your current situation give you to improve at)

*Define Good*

Basic goal oriented stuff here.  Decide what level you need
to get to - and then track it and get there.

*Stretch & Destroy*
Be aware of the stuff you're finding hard, then push into
it and get better.

*Be Patient*
It takes time, unfortunately
