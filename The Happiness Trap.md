> So here is the happiness trap in
> a nutshell: to find happiness, we try to avoid or get rid of bad feelings—but
> the harder we try, the more bad feelings we create.

> Thoughts=words inside our heads Images=pictures inside our heads Sensations=feelings
> inside our bodies.

> In ACT, our main interest in a thought is not whether it’s true or false,
> but whether it’s helpful; that is, does it help us create the life we
> want?

> In a state of cognitive fusion, it seems as if: •  Thoughts are reality—as
> if what we’re thinking were actually happening.

> In a state of cognitive fusion, it seems as if: •  Thoughts are reality—as
> if what we’re thinking were actually happening. •  Thoughts are the truth—we
> completely believe them. •  Thoughts are important—we take them seriously
> and give them our full attention. •  Thoughts are orders—we automatically
> obey them. •  Thoughts are wise—we assume they know best and we follow
> their advice. •  Thoughts can be threats —some thoughts can be deeply
> disturbing or frightening.

> ‘I’m having the thought that...’ Now run that thought again, this time
> with the phrase attached. Think to yourself, ‘I’m having the thought that
> I am X.’

> Cognitive defusion reminds us that thoughts are just words. In a state
> of defusion, we recognise: •  Thoughts are merely sounds, words, stories
> or bits of language. •  Thoughts may or may not be true; we don’t automatically
> believe them. •  Thoughts may or may not be important; we pay attention
> only if they’re helpful. •  Thoughts are definitely not orders; we certainly
> don’t have to obey them. •  Thoughts may or may not be wise; we don’t
> automatically follow their advice. •  Thoughts are never threats; even
> the most negative of thoughts is not deeply disturbing or frightening.

> Now go back to the thought in its original form. Once again, hold it in
> your mind and believe it as much as you can, for about ten seconds. Notice
> how it affects you. *** Now imagine taking that thought and singing it
> to the tune of ‘Jingle Bells’. Sing it silently inside your head. Notice
> what happens.

> Identify your mind’s favourite stories, then give them names, such as the
> ‘loser!’ story, or the ‘my life sucks!’ story, or the ‘I can’t do it!’
> story.

> The more pragmatic approach is to ask, ‘Is this thought helpful?

> For now, suffice to say, thoughts that criticise you, insult you, judge
> you, put you down or blame you are likely to lower your motivation rather
> than increase it.

> So when troublesome thoughts pop into your head, it may be useful to ask
> yourself one or more of the following questions: •  Is this thought in
> any way useful or helpful? •  Is this an old thought? Have I heard this
> one before? Do I gain anything useful from listening to it again? •  Does
> this thought help me take effective action to improve my life? •  What
> would I get for believing this thought?

> This is a simple and effective defusion technique. When your mind starts
> coming up with those same old stories, simply thank it.

> You could acknowledge, ‘Aha! Here’s the “imminent death” story’ or ‘I’m
> having the thought that I’ll be dead soon’ or you could simply say, ‘Thanks,
> Mind!’

> The aim of defusion is not to get rid of unpleasant thoughts, but rather
> to see them for what they are —just words—and to let go of struggling
> with them.

> Suppose you are walking across ice. In order to safely take the next step,
> you first need to find a firm foothold. If you try moving forward without
> doing that, then you’re likely to fall flat on your face. Acceptance is
> like finding that firm foothold. It’s a realistic appraisal of where your
> feet are and what condition the ground is in. It doesn’t mean that you
> like being in that spot, or that you intend to stay there.

> So should you believe any of your thoughts? Yes, but only if they’re helpful—and
> hold those beliefs lightly. And even while you’re holding them, know that
> they are nothing more than language.
