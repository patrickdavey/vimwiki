### AoC tips from https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18559619
stdlib: binascii, collections (especially defaultdict), fractions (gcd), itertools (combinations, combinations_with_replacement, permutations, product, izip, chain), md5, re, os/sys.

Non-std: networkx (graphs and shortest path), sympy (isprime()), numpy (efficient representation of large arrays).

It's useful to have a canned exhaustive tree search prepared (breadth/depth/"best"-first search).

You can use complex numbers to represent 2-dimensional coordinates and direction; turning the unit vector left and right involves multiplying by 1j and -1j, respectively, and movement is addition.
