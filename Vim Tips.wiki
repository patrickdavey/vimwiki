Update all helptags `:Helptags`

Using Vim Surround add quotes around a word:
    `csw'`

To use auto correct - `z=`

Sometimes when copying and pasting in text from windows / docx or whatever you
get hex chars which aren't utf-8.  If you want to do a search and replace you
can

# Find the hex code by putting your cursor on the charachter and pressing `ga`
# Then use a search/replace string as normal but specifying hex.  E.G
  `:%s/\%xNN//g`
