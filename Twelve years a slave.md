Wow, what a book. [Amazon link](http://www.amazon.com/12-Years-Slave-Solomon-Northup/dp/1631680021/). Makes you just incredibly angry and incredulous to see what slavery was like. Kidnapped into slavery and forced to work for 12 years until final rescue.  Amazing that he was able to survive at all, let alone keep his humanity.

Lessons to be learned I suppose in how people can become utterly defeated & broken given enough time. Also, how your humanity can be completely warped by the surroundings you are brought up in. They simply didn't see black people as human.

I can highly recommend this book.
