Really enjoyed this STABLE acronym from Sarah Mei:

* S: Smell your code
* T: Make Tiny changes first
* A: Augment tests (one level above what you're trying to refactor)
* B: Back up when necessary
* L: Leave it better than you found it.
* E: Expect good reasons (there's probably a good reason the
  code is in the state it's in - e.g. pressure, change over time, inexperience)
