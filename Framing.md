The way that options are framed cause us to be risk averse (if positive frame) or risk seeking (if negative frame)

nice example of

1. Option A = you get $250 
2. Option B = 25% change you get $1000, 75% you get 0

Difference in framing is whether you get this as cash, or would have to pay it out as cash.

Very interesting - showed one of the Kahenman questions about saving lives, negative framing totally made me choose the risk seeking alternative (for exactly the same conditions, just framed differently)
