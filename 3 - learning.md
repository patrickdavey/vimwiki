- Pomodoro - head down no distractions (focused mode) for 25 mins.
- Brain needs time to put focused mode into long term storage - so actually
taking a break and thinking of something else - or nothing - for a while
may actually be a good thing.  I wonder if mindfullness comes in here?
- Exercise - it's key.  And I think maybe listening to those podcasts all the time isn't actually the best idea in the world.
Just when does my brain get downtime?
- Need to practice, and need to _not_ look up the solution.  That is how you get the content into your long term memory.  So the
next time I'm trying something, just do it, and then look for a solution if I can't work it out. Easier said than done when a
quick SO post will probably solve the issue.  Still, one to think about.


## Chunks

How the brain groups new material into blobs of cohesive information.  You need to relate the new info to other data
so that it will all be retained.  Just learning isolated facts doesn't mean you will be able to use the info later.

- Focussed Attention
  - no TV, no smartphone, no interruptions.  You want as much of your focused working memory to be involved in the task as possible.
- Understanding<br/>
You need to actually understand the material, rather than thinking that discreet pieces of information will magically weave themselves
together into a chunk.  One effective way, especially when you're learning new stuff, is to test / recall the info after you can have
just learned it.  That way you will find out whether you really have understood it or not. _Close the book and test yourself!_
- Practice.  Part of this is gaining context.  IE the attention & understanding parts get you the chunk (what it is), the practice gives you the
bigger picutre of when to use the particular chunk.
