- Pomodoro - head down no distractions (focused mode) for 25 mins.
- Brain needs time to put focused mode into long term storage - so actually
taking a break and thinking of something else - or nothing - for a while
may actually be a good thing.  I wonder if mindfullness comes in here?
- Exercise - it's key.  And I think maybe listening to those podcasts all the time isn't actually the best idea in the world.
Just when does my brain get downtime?
- Need to practice, and need to _not_ look up the solution.  That is how you get the content into your long term memory.  So the
next time I'm trying something, just do it, and then look for a solution if I can't work it out. Easier said than done when a
quick SO post will probably solve the issue.  Still, one to think about.
