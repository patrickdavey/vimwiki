## Selected quotes from This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. The Climate

> And perhaps most critically, how would provisions that allowed private
> companies to sue national governments over laws that impinged on their
> profits dissuade governments from adopting tough antipollution regulations,
> for fear of getting sued?

> What industry calls innovation, in other words, looks more like the final
> suicidal throes of addiction. We are blasting the bedrock of our continents,
> pumping our water with toxins, lopping off mountaintops, scraping off
> boreal forests, endangering the deep ocean, and scrambling to exploit
> the melting Arctic—all to get at the last drops and the final rocks. Yes,
> some very advanced technology is making

> According to one highly credible study, that amount of carbon is 565 gigatons
> between 2011 and 2049. And as Bill McKibben points out, “The thing to
> notice is, 2,795 is five times 565. It’s not even close.” He adds: “What
> those numbers mean is quite simple. This industry has announced, in filings
> to the SEC and in promises to shareholders, that they’re determined to
> burn five times more fossil fuel than the planet’s atmosphere can begin
> to absorb.”57 Those numbers also tell us that the very thing we must do
> to avert catastrophe—stop digging—is the very thing these companies cannot
> contemplate without initiating their own demise.

> implausible no-consequences stories all the time, about how we can ravage
> the world and suffer no adverse effects. Indeed we are always surprised
> when it works out otherwise. We extract and do not replenish and wonder
> why the fish have disappeared and the soil requires ever more “inputs”
> (like phosphate) to stay fertile. We occupy countries and arm their militias
> and then wonder why they hate us. We drive down wages, ship jobs overseas,
> destroy worker protections, hollow out local economies, then wonder why
> people can’t afford to shop as much as they used to. We offer those failed
> shoppers subprime mortgages instead of steady jobs and then wonder why
> no one foresaw

> Extractivism is also directly connected to the notion of sacrifice zones—places
> that, to their extractors, somehow don’t count and therefore can be poisoned,
> drained, or otherwise destroyed, for the supposed greater good of economic
> progress. This toxic idea has always been intimately tied to imperialism,
> with disposable peripheries being harnessed to feed a glittering center,
> and it is bound up too with notions of racial superiority, because in
> order to have sacrifice zones, you need to have people and cultures who
> count so little that they are considered deserving of sacrifice.

> whatever we do, and its trajectory cannot be predicted. It is a living
> breathing collection of organisms (mostly microorganisms) that are evolving
> every second—a ‘self-organizing, complex, adaptive system’ (the strict

> “The notion that science will save us is the chimera that allows the present
> generation to consume all the resources it wants, as if no generations
> will follow. It is the sedative that allows civilization to march so steadfastly
> toward environmental catastrophe. It forestalls the real solution, which
> will be in the hard, nontechnical work of changing human behavior.” And
> worst of all, it tells us that, “should the fix fail, we have someplace
> else to go.”

> In 2003, O’Connor began to report that, while treating patients in Fort
> Chipewyan, he was coming across alarming numbers of cancers, including
> extremely rare and aggressive bile-duct malignancies. He quickly found
> himself under fire from federal health regulators, who filed several misconduct
> charges against him with the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta
> (including raising “undue alarm”). “I don’t know, personally, of any situation
> where a doctor has had to go through what I’ve gone through,” O’Connor
> has said of the reputational smears and the years spent fighting the allegations.
> He was, eventually, cleared of all charges and a subsequent investigation
> of cancer rates vindicated

> Put another way, a broken bank is a crisis we can fix; a broken Arctic
> we cannot.

> democratically elected government amounted to an “arbitrary, capricious,
> and illegal revocation of the Enterprise’s valuable right to mine for
> oil and gas under the St. Lawrence River.” It also claimed (rather incredibly)
> that this occurred “with no cognizable public purpose”—not to mention
> “without a penny of compensation.”46

> beginning of the buildup of excess atmospheric carbon. So another way of
> thinking about this history is that, starting two centuries ago, coal

> continually built up in the atmosphere, it gave these same nations the
> means to inadvertently appropriate their descendants’ sky as well, gobbling

> But we will not win the battle for a stable climate by trying to beat the
> bean counters at their own game—arguing, for instance, that it is more

> land, for depriving today’s children of their right to live in a world
> teeming with the wonders and beauties of creation.
