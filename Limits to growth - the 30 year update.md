## Various quotes from the book

    The estimated rates of extintion are now 1,000 times
    what they would be without human impact.


    At present, there is little near-term concern over petroleum
    supplies... The world's petroleum resources are finite, however,
    and global production will eventually peak and then start to
    decline... More conventional estimates suggest that global
    production will not peak for another decade or two, somewhere
    between 2010 and 2025.
