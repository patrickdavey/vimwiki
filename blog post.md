I headed off to RailsCamp Australia this weekend, like [link] the
New Zealand camps, it's an excuse to get away to a remoteish part
of the world - or at least out of cellphone coverage.  Once at the
camp, the agenda is created by the participants, if you have something
you want to present, you present, if you have something you'd like to
hear about, you write it up and hope that someone will run a workshop.

The kiwi contingent was 6 of us in total, it was great getting to travel
across with Phil Arndt and Amanda Wagener from Christchurch.  Once in
Sydney we met up with three more rubyists, Juri ?, Nahum Wild and James
Harton.  Good people all.  I discovered that Nahum is a fellow Raspberry
Pi enthuisast .. his cat door tweets everytime they come in and out of the
house.  The Internet of Things (IoT).. it's coming folks ;)

After a taxi into town we met up with the rest of the crowd of 170 odd people
who were going to the camp, and got a train + then a boat to [place]  I had
opted to take the tent again, no [link] Kea this time to chew holes in my tent,
just snakes, leeches and killer spiders to contend with (honestly, Australia
has it in for the population!).  I kid, snakes at least pretty much hibernate
during winter I'm told, though we did see leeches!

The rest of the time was spent eating great food, limitless beer, wine and even
mulled wine, games of werewolves, and of course, presentations. It was great to see
so many new developers joining the community.  I'd hazard a guess that it was
about 20% or so, at a very rough guess.  Encouraging.  

I did a presentation on Vim (my editor of choice) and Tmux, it was pretty off the
cuff as I'd not prepared one, but one of the rubyists wrote that they'd like to
hear about it, and so I volunteered.  As expected, there were plenty of experienced
vim enthusiasts who came along, and I definitely learned as much from the crowd as
I managed to present - just what you want! :)

I enjoyed the talks on "buildpacks", a way of packaging your assets that looked interesting
and I also enjoyed the introduction to React which I've not yet had the opportunity to
experiment with. Looking around at the weekend, there was certainly a lot of people talking
about and using other technologies, Elixir and Ember not least.

I thoroughly enjoyed the lightning talks, on the Sonic Pi, connecting multiple databases to
continuous integration, sublime text packages, Interactor Pattern / Gourmet Service Objects
and I also did a quick talk on one of my favourite books called "Crucial Conversations". It's
about how to say in dialog when things get difficult.

While the Australians were having their AGM, a few of us went for a short bush walk, that
was where we came across the leeches.  Good times.  Last time I saw those was in Tasmania,
and I haven't become any more fond of them since then I can assure you!

All too soon it was time for the wrap up and final presentations of what people had done
over the weekend.  I enjoyed them all, especially the newest developers showing off
what they were working on - super impressive and just great that they had the confidence
and felt the real support in the room for wishing them well on their onward journey
into the Ruby & Rails community.  I did a very quick presentation to show off the
Raspberry Pi which I'd brought along and made a timelapse of the weekend.  I really
think they're such excellent learning tools and also just fun to play with.  Another
developer Paul had brought along his "Retro" Pi, which is setup for playing old Nintendo 
, Sega, Commodore 64 etc. games on.  There was much bubble bobble and bomber man played.  Now, to
get some controllers for the office - I've been dying to play MarioKart for the longest time!

So yes, a great conference, many thanks to Len, James and Keith for organising it.
